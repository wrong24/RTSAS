Hey there fellow coder:
About:
This program works on importing complex stock data from an API (in this case Yahoo's API) and gives the user the functions to search for several stock, compare them using the variety of graphs like Candle Stick graphs and Volatility graphs. The user can store their data in a seperate file and access it anytime in the future.

Libraries Used:
The code takes the help of the following libraries :
numpy
pandas
datetime
matplotlib
pandas_datareader

Additional Note:
The path of the file "user_profile.csv" must be mentioned under the definition of create_profile() at line 20 in the code.

Thankyou.
